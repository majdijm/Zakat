              <p>Zakat is one of the five pillars of Islam and is obligatory on Muslims whose wealth exceeds the Nisab threshold.</p>

              <p>The Nisab is defined as approximately 85 grams of gold or 595 grams of silver.</p>
              <p>Many scholars recommend using the silver standard as it results in a lower threshold, benefiting more people in need.</p>
